This project involves data analysis and visualization for customer churn prediction. The dataset contains customer usage data, including total day calls, total night calls, and total international calls. The analysis includes creating pairplots to explore the relationships between these variables and how they correlate with customer churn. The results can help identify patterns in customer behavior that may lead to churn.
